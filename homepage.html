                    <p>Industry 4.0 refers to a new phase in the Industrial Revolution that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, 
                        automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Industry 4.0, also sometimes referred to as IIoT or smart manufacturing, marries physical production and operations with 
                        smart digital technology,machine learning,and big data to create a more holistic and better-connected ecosystem for companies that focus on manufacturing and supply chain 
                        management. While every company  and organization operating today is different, they all face a common challenge—the need for connectedness and access to real-time insights 
                        across processes, partners, products, and people.</p>

                    <h1> Internet of Things </h1>
                    <p>The "Internet of things" (IoT) is becoming an increasingly growing topic of conversation both in the workplace and outside of it. It's a concept that not only has the 
                        potential to impact how we live but also how we work. But what exactly is the "Internet of things" and what impact is it going to have on you, if any? There are a lot of 
                        complexities around the "Internet of things" but I want to stick to the basics. Lots of technical and policy-related conversations are being had but many people are still
                        just trying to grasp the foundation of what the heck these conversations are about.</p>

                    <p>Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. But it’s not the amount 
                        of data that’s important. It’s what organizations do with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business 
                        moves.</p>

                    <h1> Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality </h1>
                    <p>Virtual reality (VR) immerses people in experiences, often with a lot of expensive technology such as headsets. Augmented reality, on the other hand, usually starts with 
                        a real-life view of something (such as the camera of a mobile phone), and projects or inserts images onto the screen or viewer.</p>
                    <p>Augmented reality (AR) is VR’s cousin and makes no pretense of creating a virtual world. Unlike VR, AR is accessed using much more common equipment such as mobile phones, 
                        and it superimposes images such characters on top of video or a camera viewer, which most consumers already have, making it much more usable for retail, games, and movies.</p>

                     intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually
                      every sector of the tech industry. </p>
